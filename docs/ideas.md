# Ideas

Game ideas:

- 'Level 13' - A floor in a hotel where the player has to fight ghosts or find them.
- 'Room 13' - Room 13 is haunted... By you. Guests will stay in the room, you need to scare them. Can microphone input be used to capture sounds made by the player? You need to hide behind the bed to not be seen by the player and then when they go to bed you jump and make noise. Goals of the game are to not be seen (Stay in the shadows) and make a loud noise to scare the guest.
